# Tasteless - Music Rating Software for the Cultured Individual
Tasteless rates your Spotify library and tells you if you need to reevaluate your choices in music and/or life.
Built with Spotify and Indico API, Tasteless uses "state-of-the-art" Sentiment-Analyzing AI From The Futureâ„¢ to search the web for music reviews of all your favorite songs, in order to calculate your Music Appreciation Score. It may also silently judge your browsing habits as it does so.
If your idea of a fun time is having more things to be insecure about, maybe Tasteless is the app for you.
